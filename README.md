# golang-wayland

Trying to get a window in Wayland w/o using libwayland.

Thanks to [rajveermalviya/go-wayland](https://github.com/rajveermalviya/go-wayland) for
serving as a reference and [Wayland Explorer](https://wayland.app) making it a lot easier.
Other references are the [Wayland Book](https://wayland-book.com) and the [freedesktop
docs](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/).
